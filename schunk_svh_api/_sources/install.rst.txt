Installation
============

Using CMake
-----------

1. Install CMake and a C++ compiler that supports C++17.
2. Create a build directory and navigate into it:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir build
      cd build

3. Run CMake to configure the project:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cmake ..

4. Build the project:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cmake --build .

5. Optionally, install the library and tools:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo cmake --install .

Using Colcon
------------

The repository is a valid Colcon package. To build it put the package in your `Colcon workspace`_ and `build the workspace`_.

.. _Colcon workspace: https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/what-is-a-workspace.html
.. _build the workspace: https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/quick-start.html

UDEV rules
----------

To enable consistent naming of the device as `/dev/schunk_svh` and `/dev/schunk_svh<SERIAL_NUMBER>`, follow these steps:

1. Copy the UDEV rules file to the appropriate directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo cp udev/43-schunk-svh.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

2. Reload the udev rules and trigger them:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
      sudo udevadm trigger

4. Verify the device is correctly named:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ls -l /dev/schunk_svh*

.. note::

      If you are running the API or derived driver in a Docker container,
      you have to perform the bove steps in the host system.

.. note::

      The serial number is read from the USB-to-Serial converter chip and
      it will not match the serial number of the hand itself. It is still useful when connecting
      multiple hands to the same computer as long as you connect the hand consistently
      to the same adapter.
